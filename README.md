C# Collatz Conjecture (The 3N+1 Problem) experiment
<br><br><br>
This is a Windows application written in C# that experiments with the <b><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collatz_conjecture">Collatz Conjecture</a></b>, otherwise known as the '3N+1 Problem'.
The conjecture is as follows:<br>

<i>Take any natural number n. If n is even, divide it by 2 to get n / 2. If n is odd, multiply it by 3 and add 1 to obtain 3n + 1. Repeat the process indefinitely. The conjecture is that no matter what number you start with, you will always eventually reach 1.</i><br><br>
I made this program to test this conjecture (and to satisfy my own curiosity). Input two numbers and it will calculate how many <b><a href="http://mathworld.wolfram.com/HailstoneNumber.html">hailstone numbers</a></b> the collatz conjecture generates for every number between them. The full source and its visual studio project are available here.
